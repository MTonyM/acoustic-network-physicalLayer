CS120 project
We finished the physical layer. When i transfer 10000 bits, it has ~0.01-0.5 % err rate. And no CRC checking, worth 9 pt. 
You should not copy my code for homework. It is my contribution and my partner @Yenene Â https://github.com/Yenene78 's contribution. You can use it and give your instructor cite infomation.
